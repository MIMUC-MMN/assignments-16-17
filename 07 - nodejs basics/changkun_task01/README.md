## Task1: Web 2.0?

### a) characteristics of Web 2.0

- Social Aspect

  1. Collaboration 
  2. User-Generated Content

- Technical Aspect
  
  1. Rich Internet Applications(multimedia)
  2. Web browser as application platform
  3. Increasing interactivity in the browser

### b) Web 2.0 trends

I would say `Yes, we still in Web 2.0, but nowadays term Web 2.0+ is more appropriate.` There are three reason:

1. Nowadays, we have more web technologies make `Web 2.0` much better to interact with people, for example:

  - sigle page application
  - AJAX/RESTful API
  - Use web tech to implement mobile native Apps

2. Even with this technologies, the main idea of “user-generated content” is still the same.

3. Web 3.0 was proposed as Semantics Web, obviously, it is not achieved yet, even the state of the art HTTP/2 is still not appropriate.
