## 1. What is screen scraping?

Screen scraping[1] is the process of collecting screen display data from one application and translating it so that another application can display it.

This is normally done to capture data from a legacy application in order to display it using a more modern user interface.

The screen scraping application must usually do both of the following:

* Capture screen input and pass it on to the legacy application for processing
* Return data from the application to the user and display it properly on the user's screen

## 2. Who uses screen scraping?

People who would like to save time or steal user infomation. For example[2], In the 1980s, someone wrote applications to capture and convert character data as numeric data for inclusion into calculations for trading decisions without re-keying the data.

## 3. Are we allowed to show screen shots of arbitrary web sites on our own web site?

Of course we cannot show screen shots from every web sites, contents are copyright by its author. But sometimes it depends on the lisence of the websites. For example, WTFPL[3] License allows us that everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim or modified copies of document content, and changing it is allowed as long as the name is changed.
