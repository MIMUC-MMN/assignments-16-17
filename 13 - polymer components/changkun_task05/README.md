## Task 5: Metadata & Multimedia Content Description

### a) The company uses software to manage the video catalogue. Next week, there will be a short documentary on the presidential election in the U.S. Please name 3 types of criteria that can be used to find related video clips on the topic. Indicate if this data is high- or low-level metadata.

|Search/Filter Criterion:|Type of metadata:|
|:--:|:--:|
|Keywords|low-level|
|starting time|low-level|
|length of clip|low-level|
|slip summary|high-level|

###  b) So far, the company relies on its employees to manually create and aggregate metadata about any video clip. Explain how this process could be speed up. Include at least one concrete technology in your answer.

MPEG-7 is a stadard for describing multimedia content data (including video). Thus, technology like MPEG7 descriptor(e.g. Camera Motion Descriptor) could use to create content description such that to speed up our video clip management.

### c) The company asks you about your opinion to switch to an MPEG-7 compatible software. Provide one argument both in favor and against MPEG-7.

Advantages:

- Multimedia files become as searchable as text files.

Disadvantages:

- Feature extraction requires separate software that is only applicable to a limited number of files.
